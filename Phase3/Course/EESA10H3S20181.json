The past century has seen intense industrialization characterized by the widespread production and use of chemicals and the intentional and unintentional disposal of a wide range of waste materials. This course explores the relationship between the incidence of disease in human populations and the environmental pollution. Emphasis will be placed on understanding where and what pollutants are produced, how they are taken up by humans and their long term effects on health; the role of naturally-occurring carcinogens will also be examined. The course will include a view of risk assessment and toxicology using case studies. No prior knowledge of environmental or medical science is required.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L30", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 68400, "end": 75600, "duration": 7200, "location": "AC 223"}], "size": 500, "enrolment": 0}]}
