{"id": "GGR317H5S20181", "code": "GGR317H5S", "name": "The Cryosphere", "description": "Snow and ice dominate the Canadian landscape. There is virtually no area in Canada that escapes the influence of snow and ice. We skate on frozen ponds, ski down snow covered mountains, drive through snow blizzards and watch how ice jams in rivers cause rivers to swell and floods to occur. The duration and the thickness of snow and ice increase rapidly northwards, and glaciers are found in mountainous areas and in large parts of the Arctic region. Given that snow and ice impact heavily on the Canadian way of life, this course seeks to understand the dynamics of snow and ice in a hydrological context. This course will examine snow properties, snow cover distribution, glacier hydrology, melt runoff, and ice in its many forms (lake ice, river ice, sea ice, and ground ice). This course will also examine some of the recent observed changes occurring in the cryosphere regions of Canada.\u00a0This course fulfills 2 field days.\u00a0[24L, 12P]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Geography", "prerequisites": "GGR214H5/217H5", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["L Brown"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 210"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 26}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "DV 2060"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 16}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "DV 2060"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 10}]}
