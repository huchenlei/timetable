This course provides a holistic treatment of the stream ecosystem, with particular emphasis on nutrient and contaminant transformation, in-stream hydraulics and morphology, the hyporheic, parafluvial, and riparian zones, as well as hillslope hydrological processes responsible for transfer of water to the stream. Variability in stream biota, community interactions, and ecosystem-level processes are also discussed. Weekly field and lab exercises provide the student with hands-on experience with the lecture material.\u00a0This course fulfills 4 field days.\u00a0[24L, 36P]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Geography", "prerequisites": "GGR217H5 or GGR227H5 or BIO205H5", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}
