{"id": "ANT214H5S20175S", "code": "ANT214H5S2", "name": "Anthropology of Food and Nutrition", "description": "This course explores human food use and nutrition from a broad anthropological perspective. It examines archaeological and osteological evidence of dietary patterns of human ancestors. It explores significant food 'revolutions', from the origins of agriculture to the relatively recent phenomenon of biotechnological food production. It uses a wide range of theoretical approaches from biological and sociocultural anthropology to understand the patterns of food production, distribution and consumption observed today. The goal of the course is to provide students with a broad understanding of the many anthropological approaches to the study of food and nutrition.
