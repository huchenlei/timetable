This course addresses the use of organ systems to find and process food, escape enemies by locomotion, reproduce by pollination vectors, filter nutrients, exchange gases, coordinate and make decisions. Content includes the mechanics of moving in fluids by swimming and flying, sending and receiving of signals at body surfaces, the microstructure of materials. Forces are seen to have adaptively affected the shape and leverage of skeletons.
