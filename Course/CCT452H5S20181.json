It will study the history of graphic design to the present in roughly chronological order; it will focus on specific topics rather than on movements, schools or chronological events. Topics will highlight how social trends, political forces, technological innovation and continuing folk traditions all contribute to the visual environment we all inhabit today. Topics will emphasize popular culture as a force shaping graphic design while also referring to a theoretical graphic design discourse.
