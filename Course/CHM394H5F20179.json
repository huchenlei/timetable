{"id": "CHM394H5F20179", "code": "CHM394H5F", "name": "Chemical Synthesis Laboratory I", "description": "The first in a sequence of two laboratory courses in synthetic chemistry. This laboratory course comprises the synthesis of inorganic and organic compounds supplemented by physical measurements (e.g., ir, uv, 1H NMR spectra, magnetic susceptibility, etc.) of the products where appropriate. Approximately six weeks each will be spent on two groups of foundational experiments, one in organic and one in inorganic synthesis to illustrate techniques of chemical synthesis. The central role of the carbonyl group in organic synthesis is elaborated, an organic unknown is identified both chemically and spectroscopically and the synthetic chemistry of the first row transition elements is explored.
