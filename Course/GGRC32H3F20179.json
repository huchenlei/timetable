With an emphasis on spatial thinking in an urban context, topics such as distance decay, distance metrics, spatial interaction, spatial distributions, and spatial autocorrelation will be used to quantify spatial patterns and identify spatial processes. These tools are the essential building blocks for the quantitative analysis of urban spatial data.Area of focus: Urban Geography", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Human Geography (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "Any 8.0 credits including [STAB23H3 and GGRB30H3]", "exclusions": "GGR276H", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["S Farber"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "BV 361"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0001", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BV 471"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
