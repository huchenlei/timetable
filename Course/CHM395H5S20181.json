{"id": "CHM395H5S20181", "code": "CHM395H5S", "name": "Chemical Synthesis Laboratory II", "description": "The second in a sequence of two laboratory courses in synthetic chemistry that builds on the foundations established in CHM394H5. Students choose their own experiments in this course from offerings comprising the synthesis of organic, organometallic and inorganic compounds and in computational chemistry. Techniques such as working at low temperatures and in inert atmospheres (e.g., glove box) are introduced. Depending on the experiments actually chosen, a mixed organic unknown is separated and identified, organic rearrangements and the synthetic chemistry of elements from across the Periodic Table including main group, transition elements and lanthanides are explored. A highlight is an optional four week independent synthesis project in any area of synthetic chemistry adapting procedures from the published, including recent, research literature.
