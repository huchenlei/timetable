In any given year we will focus on the work of a particular important thinker or a school of thought. As we examine trends and approaches that have been influential to the field, we consider the debates these have generated, the ethnographic innovations they have inspired, and their relevance for core debates in anthropology. Topics and readings will be chosen annually by the instructor.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Anthropology (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "ANTB19H3 and ANTB20H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}
