{"id": "NROC36H3S20181", "code": "NROC36H3S", "name": "Molecular Neuroscience", "description": "This course will focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal communication in the central nervous system. The first module will look into synaptic transmission at the molecular level, spanning pre and postsynaptic mechanisms. The second module will focus on molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Additional topics will include an introduction to the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and channelopathies.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Psychology (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "NROB60H3 and BIOB10H3", "exclusions": "NULL", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["M Arruda Carvalho"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "SW 128"}], "size": 100, "enrolment": 0}]}
