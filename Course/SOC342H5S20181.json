How are scandals 'made'? How are scandals represented? and What are the consequences of scandals? The course will pay attention to how scandals are made public: Leaks, investigations, whistleblowers, and media reporting, and the framing of events as scandals worth of public condemnation. To do so, this course will focus on scandals among professionals, in the private corporate sector and in government, domestically and worldwide, both current and past. By understanding scandals as sociological events, students will learn to trace how scandals may lead to new organizational, professional, social, cultural, and political responses.
