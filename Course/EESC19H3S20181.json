This course will introduce students to the dynamics of ocean environments, ranging from the deep ocean basins to marginal seas to the coastal ocean. The large-scale water circulation is examined from an observationally based water mass analysis and from a theoretical hydro-dynamical framework. The circulation of marginal seas, the role of tides, waves and other currents are studied in terms of their effects upon the coastal boundary.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "EESB03H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "IC 120"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0001", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "HW 308"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
